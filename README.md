# DepthyOffline

Originally made in 2016 because I wanted offline version of the app, but had problems with WEBM export.
Later I found that source code at https://github.com/panrafal/depthy is not up to date with site version.
This repo is basically QWebEngine running local site version.

The source is Qt5 project (made in QtCreator).
The build is Windows 64bit setup.
